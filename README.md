## Problem Overview

ConnectTel Telecom Company faces the pressing need to address customer churn, which poses a significant threat to its business sustainability and growth. The company's current customer retention strategies lack precision and effectiveness, resulting in the loss of valuable customers to competitors. To overcome this challenge, ConnectTel aims to develop a robust customer churn prediction system for which I handled as a Data Scientist.

By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques on available customer data, the company seeks to accurately forecast customer churn and implement targeted retention initiatives. This proactive approach will enable ConnectTel to reduce customer attrition, enhance customer loyalty, and maintain a competitive edge in the highly dynamic and competitive telecommunications industry.

## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation related to the ConnectTel Customer Churn Prediction project. The project's main goals include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing the provided customer data to gain insights into customer behavior and characteristics.
- Data Preprocessing: Preparing and cleaning the data for machine learning model development.
- Machine Learning Model Development: Building and training machine learning models to predict customer churn.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using relevant metrics and techniques.
- Deployment: Preparing the model for deployment in a production environment.

## Repository Structure
